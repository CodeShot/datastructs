# Datastructs

To compile library run (in basedir):
~~~~
./configure
make
~~~~

To compile examples run (in examples/ dir):
`make`

To regenerate documentation run (in basadir):
`doxygen configure.dox`

To run examples (as shared library is not installed yet) LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs
to be set:
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./example_stack'

Have fun!
